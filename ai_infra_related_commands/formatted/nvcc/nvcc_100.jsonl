{"command": "nvcc --maxrregcount amount", "description": "Specify the maximum amount of registers that GPU functions can use.\nUntil a function-specific limit, a higher value will generally increase the performance of individual GPU threads that execute this function. However, because thread registers are allocated from a global register pool on each GPU, a higher value of this option will also reduce the maximum thread block size, thereby reducing the amount of thread parallelism. Hence, a good maxrregcount value is the result of a trade-off.\nA value less than the minimum registers required by ABI will be bumped up by the compiler to ABI minimum limit.\nUser program may not be able to make use of all registers as some registers are reserved by compiler.\nDefault\nNo maximum is assumed.", "other": "Options for Steering GPU Code Generation"}
